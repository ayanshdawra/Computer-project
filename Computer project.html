    Brain Chip
    There Are 86 Billion Neurons in our Brain which are connected
    Through Synapses. They communicate through electronic signals.
    Through the brain chip we can record these electronic signals which can create a link between the brain and technology which can help in various ways like:
        • people with paralysis to regain independence 
        • potential to treat a wide range of neurological disorders
        • Assists with the perception and interpretation of sound
          
    
    
    
    Virtual Reality Computers
    
    Computer with Virtual Reality will give students a real life environment of studying, given the VRs potential to transport the viewer into a near-natural environment. 
    
    It will benefit as:
    
        • there is scarcity of physical campuses availability which is also expensive
    
        • it will reduce travel cost and pollution
    
        • there could be on demand classes with real life experience
    
    
    
    
    
    
    Computer with Artificial Intelligence
    
    By combining new communications technology with the power of artificial intelligence (AI),Traffic cameras can automatically detect vehicles and this information with the use of AI algorithms can estimate the density of traffic on the road. 
    
    It will lead to:
    
    Less and effective management of traffic
    Reduce air and noise pollution
    Reduced number of travel time
    Reduce number of accidents
